# Sprint 3, Task 1, Design Patterns with Java

## Exercise Description:
This project focuses on identifying and implementing design patterns using the Java programming language. The goal is to understand how patterns contribute to building extensible, maintainable, and reusable software. Java and most modern frameworks are built upon these fundamental software patterns.

***Level 1:***
Basic Patterns with Singleton Implementation  
This level introduces the Singleton pattern through a console-based 'Undo' command simulation:

- Create a class `Undo` that implements the Singleton pattern.
- Allow adding, removing, and listing commands entered by the user.
- Simulate the behavior of the Linux `history` command.
- Include a `Main` class that interacts with the user and demonstrates the pattern.

***Level 2:***
Creational Patterns with Abstract Factory  
This level explores object creation based on contextual differences:

- Develop a contact manager for international addresses and phone numbers.
- Consider varying formats depending on the country.
- Implement the Abstract Factory pattern to encapsulate the creation of addresses and phone numbers.
- Demonstrate usage from the `Main` class.

***Level 3:***
Behavioral Patterns with Command  
This level focuses on separating actions from invocations using the Command pattern:

- Design a parking lot with 4 vehicles: car, bicycle, airplane, and boat.
- Implement actions such as `start`, `accelerate`, and `brake` for each vehicle.
- Use the Command pattern to encapsulate these actions.
- Demonstrate functionality from the `Main` class.
